# restaurant-page
The Odin Project. Project: Restaurant page.

First big-ish project, that i made with my own CSS, without help of bootstrap. It looks ugly, but it was just a project to try out every CSS feature i learned. The next one [Sign-up form project]([https://pages.github.com/](https://github.com/kol3x/Sign-up-form)) feels more natural and actually looks like a modern website
